# About

This repository contains some programs and resources related to competitive programming. While competitive programming usually refers to programming in a competition context, it's also useful for coding interviews.

I use this repository also as a preparation for upcoming interviews and as a general places for playing around with my own algorithm design.

## Structure

In the `src` directory you can find the source code of different algorithms. This directory is further divided into parts:

 - `cp_laaksonen`: Code related to the book by Antti Laaksonen
 - `misc`: General playground for ideas I picked up on the internet

## Books

The content of this repository is based on certain books. The most influental include:

- Guide to Competitive Programming (Antti Laaksonen)
- Introduction to Algorithms
